/*
This package provides a set of icons that can be displayed in the
system tray bar using the internal/tray-agent/app-indicator/Indicator type.

Package variables are automatically generated with the github.com/cratonica/2goarray tool that converts PNG
images into []byte. This is the format required by the github.com/getlantern/systray package that Indicator exploits.
